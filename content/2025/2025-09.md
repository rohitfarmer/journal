## 2025-09-16

I was reading on [NPR today that 9/16/25](https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5535545) is a pretty special date. Not only does it line up perfectly with the Pythagorean theorem (3² + 4² = 5²), but it's also made up of the squares of three consecutive numbers—3, 4, and 5. So 9 is 3², 16 is 4², and 25 is 5². I am not a math nerd, but it's cool to bump into something like this.

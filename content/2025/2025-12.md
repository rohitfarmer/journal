* We experienced our first snow day today here in North Bethesda, Maryland. It wasn't bad, and schools did not close, but when my kids left for school, it was still snowing. We talked about playing in the snow once they return from school, but I don't think there will be enough snow left in our courtyard by then.

* Yesterday evening, we went to Build-A-Bear Workshop to get Elsa a stuffed animal that she has been wanting for her birthday. Instead of getting a bear, she chose an [Axolotl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axolotl) - I had no idea what it was. BAB is expensive, but on birthdays, you can get their most basic bear for the same price as the kid's age. So if your kid is 2 years old, you will only pay $2; accessories are charged extra. We decided to take the birthday bear also for our little one.

* It's my baby's birthday today. I can't believe she is 8 years old now. Time flies; I feel like she was born just yesterday. I remember holding her for the first time in my arms, and she looked right at me. I had no clue what to do, I just became a father with no idea or confidence if I would be able to handle the responsibility, or know how to raise a child. I still don't know, and every day I think I am messing things up. But it's God's grace that both my kids are doing well, and we are learning to parent as they grow. I hope once they are old enough to reflect on our parenting, we will score some decent points. But today it's my baby's birthdaaayyy. Happy Birthday, Elsa. God bless you, and I wish you all happiness and success in life. Dream big, ask questions, and challenge the norms! (of course, outside the house) 😃

* After testing this journaling system for the past two days, I have now released it as a standalone Static Site Generator system that anyone can use. I named it DriftNotes: A lightweight journaling engine for thoughts that drift between tweets and blogs. This is exciting, as it will be my first non-scientific software or tool that I have created and might appeal to a general audience. Here is the link to the GitHub repository [https://github.com/rohitfarmer/driftnotes](https://github.com/rohitfarmer/driftnotes).

Yesterday, I posted on [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@rohitfarmer/115652095342331560) that I had ChatGPT create a static site generator for this journaling website, and someone asked why I did not use any of the existing generators. I did not set out to create an SSG. For this journaling website, I did not find the features in the generators that I already knew about, and it felt easier to make something of my own than to find and learning an existing one. Right now, there are hundreds of generators available, and it's hard to decide unless you already have a specific idea of which generator is best for your project. This could be both a power and a drawback of using LLMs, as for many tasks, people may find it easier to create something of their own than to use or collaborate on an existing solution. I have quite a few ideas for online projects that I can now build using ChatGPT, if not a complete product, at least a prototype.

* Today, I launched a new version of my online journal on my subdomain [https://journal.rohitfarmer.com](https://journal.rohitfarmer.com), one I had been thinking about for some time. I will still keep my [https://ctrl-c.club/~swatantra](https://ctrl-c.club/~swatantra), but will remove the journal section. This whole new website is generated by a static site generator (SSG) that I created specifically for this journal with the help of ChatGPT. It is impressive how much you can achieve using ChatGPT if you have a basic understanding of programming and can clearly explain what you are trying to build. In the new system, instead of editing the HTML directly, I write the entries in Markdown, which are then converted to HTML by a single Python build script. There are other components that I will describe in detail in a blog post once I have added more features to the system or have used it enough to confirm that it is working. If it is successful, I may release the code publicly for others to use. That will be really cool to publish an SSG that I have created from scratch. 

* I am really enjoying the new build setup for this journal website. I am now feeling motivated to publish the code in a more generalized form for people to use. It's going to be opinionated and tailored to what I want from this website, but others may find it helpful as well.

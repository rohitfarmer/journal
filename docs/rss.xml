    <description><![CDATA[<p>We returned home from Ocean City on January 1, 2026, but before we left, we went to the beach and the boardwalk after checking out. It was extremely cold, but the kids loved their time on the beach playing with the sand and then in the arcade on the boardwalk. Since Ocean City is a summer destination, it was a ghost town when we went, which is understandable. I have no complaints, as all I wanted was to get out of the house after a week-long staycation during the Christmas week, and I can never get enough of the ocean, no matter what time of the year it is. </p>
<p>The journey was tiring, and it will take me this weekend to get out of the fatigue and the sore throat I developed before I can be back to normal.</p>

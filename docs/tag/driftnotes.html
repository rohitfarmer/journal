<p>It's my baby's birthday today. I can't believe she is 8 years old now. Time flies; I feel like she was born just yesterday. I remember holding her for the first time in my arms, and she looked right at me. I had no clue what to do, I just became a father with no idea or confidence if I would be able to handle the responsibility, or know how to raise a child. I still don't know, and every day I think I am messing things up. But it's God's grace that both my kids are doing well, and we are learning to parent as they grow. I hope once they are old enough to reflect on our parenting, we will score some decent points. But today it's my baby's birthdaaayyy. Happy Birthday, Elsa. God bless you, and I wish you all happiness and success in life. Dream big, ask questions, and challenge the norms! (of course, outside the house) 😃</p>

<p>After testing this journaling system for the past two days, I have now released it as a standalone Static Site Generator system that anyone can use. I named it DriftNotes: A lightweight journaling engine for thoughts that drift between tweets and blogs. This is exciting, as it will be my first non-scientific software or tool that I have created and might appeal to a general audience. Here is the link to the GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/rohitfarmer/driftnotes">https://github.com/rohitfarmer/driftnotes</a>.</p>

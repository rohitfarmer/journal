    <p>Today, I came across an exciting YouTube channel by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@rajivsurendra">Rajiv Surendra</a>, from New York. And I watched one of his recent videos on  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCQp7K7qwU4">"Investing In  Quality, Everyday: How it Changes Your Life"</a>, where he mentioned a story about how he ended up buying a 350-pound umbrella from a specialty store in London and how, over the years, it has given him joy because of the quality of material and workmanship. He recited a compelling story that also resonated with my own philosophy. I lean towards minimalism to reduce the number of pieces I own, not necessarily of cheaper quality, though. I like things that are well-made in both material and craft. Especially the items that I use frequently. And every day I try to notice the things I use frequently and think about how I can enjoy them more by improving their quality. Obviously, there is a limit to how much I can spend on the things I desire, but buying a quality item and using it for a long time usually costs the same as buying cheap items, but multiple times over the same period. A simple example: last week, I replaced my leather boot laces with the stock nylon version, which would come undone multiple times a day, with a premium waxed-cotton version. Yes, I had to spend some extra money, but the new laces don't come undone once throughout the day, and they have taken my pleasure from my leather boots to another level.  And I have been using these boots during winter for the past three years, and the new laces have just added a few more pleasurable years to it. </p>

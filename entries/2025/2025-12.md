Today, I launched a new version of my online journal on my subdomain [https://journal.rohitfarmer.com](https://journal.rohitfarmer.com), one I had been thinking about for some time. I will still keep my [https://ctrl-c.club/~swatantra](https://ctrl-c.club/~swatantra), but will remove the journal section. This whole new website is generated by a static site generator (SSG) that I created specifically for this journal with the help of ChatGPT. It is impressive how much you can achieve using ChatGPT if you have a basic understanding of programming and can clearly explain what you are trying to build. In the new system, instead of editing the HTML directly, I write the entries in Markdown, which are then converted to HTML by a single Python build script. There are other components that I will describe in detail in a blog post once I have added more features to the system or have used it enough to confirm that it is working. If it is successful, I may release the code publicly for others to use. That will be really cool to publish an SSG that I have created from scratch.
